# arr_suite Ansible Role with Traefik

[![ansible-lint](https://github.com/marcocot/ansible_arr_suite/actions/workflows/lint.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marcocot/ansible_arr_suite/actions/workflows/lint.yaml)

Welcome to my Ansible role for setting up the *arr suite (Radarr, Sonarr, and more) using Docker and Traefik as the reverse proxy. This role automates the whole process, so you can spend less time configuring and more time managing your media!

## What's Included?

This role takes care of:
* Deploying the *arr suite of services (Radarr, Sonarr, etc.) in Docker containers
* Installing Plex Media Server in a Docker container
* Setting up Traefik as the reverse proxy, with SSL termination and proper routing
* Making sure everything runs smoothly on RedHat and Ubuntu 22.04

Tested on:
* RedHat
* Ubuntu 22.04

Before you dive in, make sure you have:

* *Docker already installed* on the target machines (this role assumes Docker is present and doesn't handle the installation). You can use `geerlingguy.docker` to install docker
* Ansible 2.9+
* Traefik configuration basics (the role handles most of it, but a Traefik entrypoint would be useful!)

## How to Use

[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/standalone/roles/marcocot/arr_suite/install/)

Super simple to get started. Just include the role in your playbook:

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  roles:
    - role: okranix.arr_suite
```

If you want to configure the services (like ports, paths, or additional *arr apps), just set some variables like so:

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  roles:
    - role: okranix.arr_suite
  vars:
    arr_traefik_version: "3.1"
```

## Running tests

To run tests locally, you need `Python 3.12`, `Poetry`, `Vagrant`, and `VirtualBox` installed. Here's how to set it up and run the tests:

### Install dependencies in the project folder with Poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

### This will install Molecule and all other necessary dependencies.

Run the tests using Molecule with Vagrant and VirtualBox:

```bash
molecule test
```

Molecule will automatically use Vagrant and VirtualBox to spin up test instances, run the role, and verify its functionality.

Feel free to contribute or open an issue if something breaks (or if Traefik decides to change something again ðŸ˜…).
